# Team Analysis Report
## Warm-up Retrospective
Team 3


### 1. Challenges Faced as a Team
The team encountered several challenges throughout the project, primarily revolving around integration, communication, and time management. Integrating various components and technologies, such as Littlefoot and Bigfoot scripts, led to dependency issues and required extra time for resolution. In particular, the unfamiliarity with new languages and plugins caused delays as team members worked to understand and implement them effectively.
Additionally, the lack of proper documentation meant that some members had to spend additional time troubleshooting issues, leading to inefficiencies. Coordinating these tasks under time constraints was challenging, as members often had overlapping commitments and tasks from other projects or classes.

### 2. Strengths and Weaknesses of Individual Contributors
- Amy demonstrated strong attention to detail and effective communication skills. However, the need for extra time to understand and document technical challenges affected her efficiency.
- Venu exhibited a clear understanding of project goals and implementation strategies but struggled with frustration when confronted with inefficiencies in the code integration process.
- Aryan showed strength in problem-solving and decision-making regarding the tech stack. However, he faced difficulties with Git organization and handling team permissions.
- Andrew brought professional experience in collaboration and documentation, which facilitated communication and project management. He needed to manage his schedules with other ongoing projects.
- Keqian actively engaged with updates and team discussions, although he faced difficulties with unfamiliar plugins and tools, leading to challenges in estimating task durations.
- Sneha excelled in team communication and task ownership but needed improvement in managing her time and estimating the effort required for multiple tasks.
- Krithika demonstrated strong collaboration skills and problem-solving but required more time to understand the technical skills, such as React, to contribute efficiently.

### 3. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Team’s Operation
The team excelled in maintaining frequent communication and ensuring that all members were updated and responsive, fostering a collaborative environment. Each member was proactive in owning and completing tasks, leading to well-coordinated contributions.
However, there were several operational weaknesses:
- Time Management: Many team members faced challenges managing their time effectively, balancing this project with other commitments. This resulted in delays and last-minute changes.
- Technical Familiarity: The team’s lack of experience with certain tools and technologies, such as GitHub’s advanced features and web development technologies, caused inefficiencies and delayed progress.
- Documentation and Organization: The lack of initial documentation and a structured approach to organizing the codebase led to difficulties in understanding and implementing features. Moreover, the absence of structured Git practices hindered seamless integration and coordination.

### 4. Recommendations for Improvement
To address the challenges and enhance the team’s efficiency, the following actions are recommended:
- Improve Git Practices: Establish a more structured Git workflow, including the division of team roles such as code reviewers for main branch merges, and standardize pull request and code review protocols.
- Time Management and Task Estimation: Adopt project management tools like Jira for task tracking and time estimation. Planning story points and allocating sufficient time for each task would help manage the workload more effectively.
- Technical Familiarity: Team members should allocate time for skill development, focusing on understanding web technologies, version control systems (Git), and project management tools to minimize learning curves during implementation.
- Documentation and Planning: Emphasize the importance of early documentation and code structuring. Implementing a pre-project setup phase to gather information and share documentation on unfamiliar technologies could reduce confusion and save time during later stages.

By implementing these strategies, the team can improve its efficiency, communication, and overall effectiveness in future projects.
