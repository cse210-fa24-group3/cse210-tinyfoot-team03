# Team Analysis Report
## Warm-up Retrospective
Team 3

### 1. Challenges Faced as a Team
The team encountered several challenges throughout the project, primarily revolving around working with new tech stacks and a tight timeline. Integrating various components and technologies, such as Littlefoot and Bigfoot scripts, led to dependency issues and required extra time for resolution. The team's unfamiliarity with TypeScript and different plugins caused delay as team members worked to understand these new tools. The lack of proper documentation for the two libraries meant that some members had to spend additional time figuring out how to get started with the library and troubleshoot issues, leading to inefficiencies. 

### 2. Strengths and Weaknesses of Individual Contributors
- Amy had strong attention to detail in regard to the assignment specifications and was effective in communicating and asking questions. However, her feeling stretched thin between other meetings and tasks affected her efficiency in writing documentation. 

- Andrew brought professional experience in collaboration and documentation, which facilitated communication and writing reviews. He was busy with other ongoing projects, and experienced issues in manage his schedule.

- Aryan showed strength in problem-solving and decision-making regarding the tech stack. He faced difficulties with Git organization and handling team permissions since he has done more individual work on GitHub in the past.

- Keqian actively engaged with updates and team discussions, although she faced difficulties with unfamiliar plugins and tools that affected her time management. 

- Krithika demonstrated strong collaboration skills and problem-solving but needed to more efficiently divide her time and understand new technical skills, such as React.

- Sneha excelled in team communication and leading the group. She, however, felt she could improve in efficiency and better estimating the effort required for her tasks.

- Venu exhibited a clear understanding of project tasks and implementation. She was able to quickly pick up new tools for the assignment as well. She felt easily frustrated when dealing with inefficiencies in the code integration process.


### 3. Strengths and Weaknesses of the Team’s Operation
The team excelled in maintaining frequent communication and ensuring that all members were updated and responsive, fostering a collaborative environment. Each member was proactive in owning and completing tasks, leading to well-coordinated contributions.


The team struggled with time management as many members had busy schedules and had to balance this project with other commitments. Members also had to learn new tools for this assignment, which was time consuming and delayed progress. The initial glossing over assignment specifics, like which directories should be used, and abscence of good Git practices made implementation less efficient and forced members to move things around more than necessary.

### 4. Improving Moving Forward
To address the challenges and enhance the team’s efficiency, the following actions are recommended:
- Improve Git Practices
    - Establish a more structured Git workflow
    - Standardize pull request and code review protocols.
    - Raise issues on Git in the future
- Time Management and Task Estimation
    - Adopt project management tools like Jira for task tracking and time estimation
    - Plan out the timeline better and allocating sufficient time for each task
    - Consider creating a sort of "budget" for how much each team member is available to spend on the project each week and assign tasks accordingly
- Technical Familiarity
    - Team members should allocate time for skill development, focusing on understanding web technologies, version control systems (Git), and project management tools to minimize learning curves during implementation.
- Documentation and Planning
    - Begin documentation early and have more members take more meeting notes
    - Paying attention to proper repository structure
    - Implement a pre-project setup phase to gather information and share documentation on unfamiliar technologies could reduce confusion and save time during later stages.

Implementing these strategies could assist the team in improving its efficiency, collaboration, and overall effectiveness in future projects.
